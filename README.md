**Running the backend**

To run the backend of our app, all you'll have to do is cd into the backend folder, run npm install, **note: may have to seperately run npm install nodemon**,
then you can call npm run devStart and you're good to go. **Note: in our .env file in the backend folder we define a LOCALURL you will need to update that to reflect your own local ip address / local host with port 3000 **
